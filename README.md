This is the beginning of Sprint 2 in the ALS SE program. This sprint focuses more on higher level programming
in python, although there will still be projects that require C. Algorithms and data structure projects will
be done in C, including other special topics such as shared libraries.

In addition to C and Python, there will also be shell projects in Bash, e.g signals and networking.
